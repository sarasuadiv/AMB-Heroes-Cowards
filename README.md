# Heroes & Cowards NetLogo Simulation

This is a computational simulation in NetLogo of the game Heroes & Cowards. The simulation was performed as part of the Agent Based Modelling course at the Santa Fe Institute. 

## Game Description
The game consists of each person in the room choosing an arbitrary friend and enemy, without telling others their choice. Participants have two possible moves:

- Hero: Placing themselves between the friend and the enemy (this move implies defending the friend).
- Coward: Placing themselves behind the friend and leaving the friend to face the enemy (this position suggests being defended by the friend).

The simulation aims to show the behaviors and emerging patterns from these two simple interaction rules.

## Requirements
To run this simulation, you will need to have the following software and libraries installed:
- NetLogo

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the NetLogo file.
2. Open the file in NetLogo
3. Run the simulation 
4. You can modify the code to try different scenarios and parameters

## Results
The simulation should show the behaviors and patterns that emerge from the simple rules of the game, and help understand the mechanisms of cooperation and defection.
